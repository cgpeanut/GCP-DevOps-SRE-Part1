Chapter 3: Foundation and Concepts
- What is (the Business of) Software Development ?
  - DevOps and SRE are about ALIGNMENT between Dev and Ops - Of Dev and Ops with the business.
  - Sofware is always an INVESTMENT  Retunred Value > Total Cost
      - Return on Investment (ROI) 
      - In a business software's main purpose is to attract value
          - sales/marketing - attracting new clients to briong more revenue (company website)
          - client support - fulfilling obligations to clients and keeping them happy
          - supplier integration - interfacing or integrating with partners and suppliers, to run the business
          - internal automation - improving employee efficiency and happiness
      - Cost of developing software:
          - Initial Development - planning and building the very first version of the system
          - Operations - That the system needs to keep running and those computers need to stay secure
          - Maintenace (Dev) - Packages need to be updated and any discovered security issues must be fixed
          - Enhancements (Dev) - Running a system invariably offers news infor or opportunitues for enhancement

     Value
     ----- = ROI, trying to get as much value as posible for less cost!
     Cost 

- How do you achiev Value in software ?
     - Joel Spolsky - A 50%-good solution that people actually have solves more problems and survives longer than a 99% solution that nobody has...
     - Shipping is a feature. A really important feature. Your product must have it.

- What's Deltas ?
      - The fundamental unit of software developement is a code change
          Every Change has:
               1. Value
               2. Cost
               3. RISK!

      - Software Devlopement is a Team Sport - Every Person is on the team
                                             - the team needs to work together
                                             - integrating work from multiple people is key (Hence Continous  integration - The CI in CI/CD) 


- What is the High-Level of Dev Process Data Flow ?
     - code base
